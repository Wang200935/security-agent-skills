  Cryptography, Forensics, Reverse Engineering, Pwn/Binary Exploitation, and Misc.
  Use when the user provides a CTF challenge, asks to train for CTFs, wants a writeup,
  or asks which CTF category/attack path to try.

# CTF General Solver

## Purpose
Use this as the router and discipline layer for any CTF task. It prevents random guessing by forcing artifact inventory, category detection, reproducible solving, and durable writeups.

## Safety Boundary
Only operate on CTF/lab/authorized targets. For live endpoints, avoid destructive actions, rate-limit requests, and never reuse techniques against real third-party services without permission.

## Skill Integration
This skill is the **CTF orchestrator** in the cybersecurity skill tree:

```
cybersecurity (master router) → ctf-general (CTF orchestrator) → domain skill
```

Load this skill when:
- The user provides a CTF challenge
- User asks to train for CTFs
- User wants a writeup
- User asks which CTF category/attack path to try

**Then** load the appropriate domain skill from the routing table below.
