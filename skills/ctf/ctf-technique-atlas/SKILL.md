description: Deep CTF technique atlas for mapping challenge clues to concrete attack patterns, tools, scripts, and next probes across Web, Crypto, Forensics, Reverse, Pwn, Misc/Jail, OSINT, Mobile, Cloud, Blockchain, Hardware/RF/ICS, Game/Protocol, and AI/ML. Use when the user asks to strengthen CTF solving ability, research all CTF techniques, classify an unknown CTF challenge, or choose the next attack path.

# CTF Technique Atlas

## Purpose

Use this skill as the deep technique index when solving or training CTFs. It maps observable clues to likely vulnerabilities, probes, tools, and solver/exploit patterns. It complements the domain skills: load the matching domain skill after classification.

## Operating rule

Do not only explain techniques. User wants practical CTF solving ability first, not mandatory boilerplate. For each challenge, create only the files/scripts needed to solve and verify the result; use full scaffolding only when the challenge is complex or the user asks for it.

## Minimal practical artifacts

For each challenge or drill, prefer the lightest useful structure:

```text
~/ctf-training/<category>/<challenge>/
  artifacts/   # original provided files, if any
  solve.py     # or exploit.py / extract.py / interact.py as appropriate
  notes.md     # short command log / key observations, only when useful
```

Do not spend time generating empty templates. The priority is: run probes, write a working solver/exploit/extractor, verify the flag, and preserve reusable lessons.

## Fast workflow

1. Inventory artifact/service/source and flag format.
2. Create minimal working files only if needed.
3. Match clues against `references/technique-matrix.md`.
4. Load the specific domain skill.
5. Run the first probes from `references/first-probes.md`.
6. Build and execute a solver/exploit/extractor from `references/solver-patterns.md`.
7. Verify flag and update skills if a reusable trick appears.

## Maintenance standard

A technique is considered learned only when Hermes can:
- recognize the clue pattern;
- run the right first probes;
- produce a minimal solver/exploit/extractor;
- explain the root cause or hidden signal;
- verify the flag;
- preserve the reusable pattern in a skill or script.
