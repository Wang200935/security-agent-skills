# Security Orchestrator — Cross-Domain Router

## When to Load

Load this skill ONLY when a security task spans multiple domains and needs
coordination. For single-domain tasks (e.g. "scan this web app", "reverse this
binary"), let the agent's native skill discovery handle routing — it is faster
and avoids loading unnecessary context.

**Use this orchestrator for:**
- Full pentest workflow (recon → web → network → post-exploitation → report)
- Multi-domain attack chains
- CTF orchestration across categories
- Parallel reconnaissance operations
- When you need to understand which skills to combine

**Total: 79 skills across 9 domains + this orchestrator**

## Routing Logic

```
User intent → route to skill:

"scan this target" / "find vulnerabilities" → recon + web-app-pentest
"exploit this bug" / "write PoC" → exploit-development
"reverse this binary" / "decompile" → reverse-engineering
"CTF challenge" / "capture the flag" → ctf-orchestrator
"enumerate network" / "port scan" → network-pentest
"OSINT on person/domain" → osint-framework
"bypass WAF" → waf-bypass-techniques
"privilege escalation" / "lateral movement" → post-exploitation-ops
"audit this code" / "security review" → security-audit
"hack IoT device" / "firmware reverse" → hardware-iot-hacking
"AI security" / "MCP vulnerability" → ai-mcp-security
"fuzz this target" / "find crashes" → zero-day-hunting
"crack this hash" / "break encryption" → cryptography-fundamentals
"pentest report" → pentest-report-generator
"jailbreak" / "escape sandbox" → ctf-misc-toolkit
```

## Parallel Execution

For multi-domain tasks, load skills in parallel:
- **Full pentest**: recon + web-app-pentest + network-pentest + post-exploitation
- **Bug bounty**: recon + web-app-pentest + exploit-dev + waf-bypass-techniques
- **CTF solve**: ctf-orchestrator routes to ctf-web-exploitation / crypto-ctf-attacks / ctf-misc-toolkit / ctf-reverse-engineering
- **Internal pentest**: network-pentest + post-exploitation + intranet-pentest-advanced
- **Hardware assessment**: hardware-iot-hacking + reverse-engineering
